# ðŸ“„ Job Criteria

To define my criteria for a company that aligns with my values and goals, so I can effectively filter out job offers that don't meet my expectations for collaboration.

1. **Minimum income:** from â‚¬800 / $900 / â‚´40,000.
2. **Work format:** remote only or with the possibility of working from an office in KoÅ¡ice. Positions in other European countries are negotiable depending on the conditions.
3. **Field:** any IT-related position that allows me to gain initial experience and enter the industry.
4. **Team:** a non-toxic, supportive environment is essential. Mentorship, understanding, and assistance are important to me. I donâ€™t want to experience stress due to difficulties â€” especially at the beginning, when proper adaptation is crucial.
5. **Schedule:** fixed, with a clear and consistent work routine.
6. **Growth:** itâ€™s important that the company offers opportunities to develop my skills and provides a direct or indirect path toward career advancement.
