### What did you do at the hackathon?

At the hackathon, our team worked on a project that involved creating an AI chat capable of analyzing, processing, and visualizing data. We used the OpenAI API for this, setting an initial system prompt that defined the AI's behavior and understanding of tasks from the start. My role in the team included organizing the workflow, working with the OpenAI API, implementing essential functions, and expanding the chatbot’s capabilities, such as supporting file uploads in various formats and converting them into a format that the AI can process. I was also responsible for writing the project documentation.
