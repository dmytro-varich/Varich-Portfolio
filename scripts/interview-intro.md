# 👋 Introduction

Hello! My name is Dmytro Varych. I am looking for a job or internship as a Full-Stack Developer (Frontend/Backend) or Data Scientist.

# 🌍 Personal Information

I was born in Ukraine, in Kharkiv, and I am currently living and studying in Košice, Slovakia.

# 🎓 Education

## 🖥 Kharkiv Radio Engineering College

My technical education began at Kharkiv Radio Engineering College, where I studied *Computer Engineering* (2019–2023).
As part of the program, I learned Python/C# programming, computer logic, operating system architecture, computer networks, microprocessors and microcontrollers, peripheral devices, soldering basics, and working with graphic editors (Photoshop, CorelDRAW).
Upon graduation, I received a junior specialist qualification.

## 🤖 Technical University of Košice (TUKE)

After the start of the full-scale war, I moved to Slovakia and continued my studies at the Technical University of Košice (TUKE) in the *Intelligent Systems* program.
Here, I studied artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, robotics, computer vision, web development, Python, C#, databases, and cloud technologies.

Currently, I have only one subject and my thesis left to complete my bachelor’s degree in 2025/2026.

# 💼 Work Experience

I had a part-time job at the GymBeam factory, where I worked as part of a team.
My main task was to locate and pick items in the warehouse according to customer orders — this helped me develop communication skills and a strong sense of responsibility.

# 🚀 Project Experience

## 🏆 Hackathons

I participated in several hackathons, where I worked in a team to create prototypes of web and AI projects.
These events gave me practical experience in making quick technical decisions, task distribution, and collaborative development.

## 🏢 Bachelor’s Thesis & Siemens Healthineers

As part of my bachelor’s thesis, I collaborated with a consultant from Siemens Healthineers, which gave me valuable experience in communicating with a representative of a major international company.
This helped me develop skills in understanding technical requirements, staying organized when planning tasks, and being responsible for meeting deadlines.

## 💻 Pet Projects & GitHub

While studying at the university, I simultaneously worked on pet projects to develop programming skills and explore different technologies.
I aimed to make each project not just a practice exercise, but a potentially useful product — first and foremost for myself, but also with the idea that it could benefit others and eventually evolve into a commercially successful solution.

In addition, I completed various tutorials, worked on university assignments, and uploaded everything to my GitHub in open access.
Some projects I deployed to servers so they could be used in real time.
I also made sure to structure projects clearly and write documentation so they would look like complete, finished products.

# 🎯 Goals & Motivation

I see a job as an opportunity not only to gain practical experience but also to grow — both professionally and personally.
My long-term goal is to create my own product or project that is not just a technical solution, but an expression of my ideas and approach.

Professionally, I am interested in moving toward project management and product concept development — I want to participate in generating and implementing ideas that, in my opinion, truly have value.

Of course, the financial side is also important — I strive for a stable income to support myself and have the resources to bring my creative and technological ideas to life.

# 🎨 Personal Interests & Hobbies

In my free time, I try to engage in creativity and bring to life ideas that come to mind — regardless of the field they belong to.
I am also interested in reading, especially books related to self-development and technology.
I enjoy music, run my own Telegram channel where I share my thoughts, style, and projects.
I try to stay active through sports and have an interest in investments and financial literacy.

# 🤝 Personal Qualities

I am responsible and able to work well in a team.
I always strive to deeply understand the task and complete it with high quality.
I have a creative mindset — I try to find non-standard solutions and approach work with initiative.
I am open to learning and constantly seek to grow in order to bring maximum value to the team and the company.
